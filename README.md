#### Secure & Scale Your Rails App with Devise and Pundit 



Welcome to the **#DevisePunditSeries** - Episode 0!

This step-by-step tutorial will guide you through building a simple Rails 8 application to test Pundit and Devise.

In this initial version, we'll set up a starter app featuring a Bootstrap 5 navbar with basic Dashboard and About pages.

A dropdown menu labeled User Functionalities is included, ready for future session-based features.

Let’s get started!
